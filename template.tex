\section*{Trip Review}
We original proposed attending Sunbelt XXXIII with the MURI program manager (J. Lavery, ARO) at a meeting in SEP 2012.  He encouraged presenting at this conference and similar ones, especially for the members of the MURI that were coming from the less social-science oriented background as a means to encourage collaboration within the group and to expose the members from natural sciences and engineering backgrounds to the questions and methods of the social sciences.

I presented MURI material in the Criminals, Gangs, Terrorists 2 session (as well as chairing that session).
That presentation lead to discussion with contacts at West Point and SAIC working on similar material.  Subsequently, we were invited to a conference to be held at West Point (pending authorization of that conference by the Academy) and are working on a possible collaboration with SAIC based on some anonymized telecom data they have.  Recent revelations about USG and contractor activities relative to this kind of data, however, have put that collaboration on indefinite hold.

I also discussed MURI-related research with other group members in attendance.

Our presentation materials available at git: \href{https://github.com/pearsonca/sunbelt13-presentation}{sunbelt-presentation} and \href{https://github.com/pearsonca/scala-commsim}{scala-commsim}.

Ultimately, the conference informed me about what methods are current in Social Network Analysis.  This insight will be highly useful as we move forward with explaining our new approaches and results to this community.
